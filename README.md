# Motion_simulator_App
It's a Python Project that simulates Motion of an object using Physic formulas

## Self Introduction 

Hey! it's **Zahabia Ahmed** here ,currently studying AI and Data Sciences with Python from **S.M.I.T** by **Miss Aqsa Moiz** ,and it's a Project Assigned by her.

## 🚀 Motion Simulator App

A physics-based simulation built with Python and Streamlit that visualizes motion using real-world formulas. Designed to help learners and enthusiasts explore concepts interactively.

### 📦 Features
- Simulates motion based on user-defined parameters
- Visualizes results with dynamic charts
- Built with NumPy and Streamlit
- Easy-to-use interface for educational purposes

### 🛠 Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ▶️ Run the App
```bash
streamlit run app/app.py
```
